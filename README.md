These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

### Installing React⚛️

To get started with React, you need to install Create React App globally. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install -g create-react-app
```

### Setting Up the Development Environment 🧑‍💻:-
-----------------------------------------

Now that you have React installed, let's create a new React app. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-awesome-app
```

Replace "my-awesome-app" with the desired name of your project.

```bash
cd my-awesome-app
```
Start the development server:
